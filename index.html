        <h3>Fujifilm Superia X-TRA 400</h3>
        <p>Fujifilm Superia X-TRA 400 is one of the most readily available films and is one of the few remaining in Fujifilm's very diminished options. It has been significantly affected by recent price gouges, but is it still worth it though? The answer would be yes.</p>

        <h3>Kodak ColorPlus 200</h3>
        <p>This is a very similar film in terms of looks and uses as Kodak Ultramax - the key difference is that it is a stop slower, with an ISO rating of 200. As such, this is the better choice of the two if you are shooting in bright outdoor conditions.</p>

        <p>Ilford's latest version of its classic fast film can be developed in traditional black-and-white chemistry. It is a great all-round film, suitable for those who just want to try monochrome – or for those who are looking for a film that will respond well to push processing for lowlight use.</p>
